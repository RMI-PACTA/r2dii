[2 `r r2dii.utils::degrees()` Investing Initiative](https://2degrees-investing.org/) (2dii) maintains a collection or R packages called r2dii. To help you install and use all those packages at once, we also built the r2dii (meta) package. The r2dii package is the only package most users need to know about. Contact us if you need more details.

Currently, r2dii allows you to access raw or lightly-prepared data, to create robust r2dii's paths, and to handle configuration files.

## Installation

To minimize installation errors, ensure your R environment is as follows:

* R version is recent.
* All packages are updated (run `update.packages()`; maybe use `ask = FALSE`).
* No other R session is running.
* Current R session is clean (click *Session \> Restart R*).

Install the development version of r2dii with:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("2DegreesInvesting/r2dii")
```

## Example

These examples provide a high level overview of the main features. For more details see [Get started](articles/r2dii.html).

Attaching r2dii automatically attaches other r2dii packages.

```{r example}
library(r2dii)
```

### Creating snapshots

```{r, child="vignettes/take-snapshot.Rmd"}

```
