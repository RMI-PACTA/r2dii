[2 `r r2dii.utils::degrees()` Investing Initiative](https://2degrees-investing.org/) maintains a collection or R packages called r2dii. To help you install and use all those packages at once, we also built the meta package r2dii. Run `library(r2dii)` to see the name of all packages in r2dii. Learn more about each package at "https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/PACKAGE/" -- for example, the website of the package r2dii.data is at <https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/r2dii.data/>.

## Installation

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("2DegreesInvesting/r2dii")
```

[How to minimize installation errors?](https://gist.github.com/maurolepore/a0187be9d40aee95a43f20a85f4caed6#installation)

## Example

These examples provide a high level overview of the main features. For more details see [Get started](articles/r2dii.html).

Attaching r2dii automatically attaches other r2dii packages.

```{r}
library(r2dii)
```

r2dii includes some utility functions.

```{r}
degrees()
sprintf("Welcome to 2%s Investing Initiative!", degrees())

clean_column_names(dplyr::group_by(tibble::tibble(x.x = 1), x.x))

# Fails
check_crucial_names(c(x = 1), expected_names = c("x", "y"))
```

It also includes datasets for examples and tests.

```{r}
# Column definitions for all datasets
data_dictionary

# Some example datasets
loanbook_demo
ald_demo
```

And it provides tools to match financial portfolios with climate data.

```{r}
match_name(loanbook_demo, ald_demo) %>% 
  prioritize()
```
