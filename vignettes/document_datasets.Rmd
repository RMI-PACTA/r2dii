This article provides guidelines to document r2dii datasets, which should make it easier to understand existing datasets and to add new ones. The guidelines are aspirational, so not all r2dii datasets may follow this guidelines. Feel free to [propose changes](https://github.com/2DegreesInvesting/r2dii/issues/new).

### Documenting generic datasets

Generic datasets (e.g. `loanbook`) should have these components:

* A generic English name that is meaningful to everyone (e.g. `loanbook`). Prefer meaningful words over shorter obscure abbreviations or acronyms (e.g. `loanbook` or `loans` is meaningful for more people than `lbk`). You don't have to type long names in full -- use auto-completion.

* A help file including:
    * A generic title and description that applies to any similar dataset.
    * `@name <generic>_description` (e.g. `loanbook_description`).
    * `@seealso data_dictionary`.
    * `@family` linking to similar datasets.
    * `@examples` showing the definitions of the generic dataset columns.

```r
# R/loanbook_description.R 

#' Description of a generic loanbook dataset
#'
#' Data on loans and borrowers. The information is usually owned by banks and
#' extreemly private.
#'
#' @name loanbook_description
#' @seealso data_dictionary
#' @family bank datasets
#' @examples
#' library(dplyr)
#'
#' data_dictionary %>%
#'   filter(dataset == "loanbook_fake") %>%
#'   select(-1)
NULL
```

The helpfile of generic objects is associated to no object in particular, so you need `NULL` for the documentation process to work.

### Documenting specific datasets

Specific datasets (e.g. `loanbook`) should have these components:

* A name like so: `<generic>_<details>`:

    * `<generic>`: Identical to the `<generic>` component in `<generic>_description` (see [Documenting generic datasets]).

    * `<details>`: A single string indicating the most prominent characteristic of the specific dataset.

For example, if your data is a kind of loanbook dataset, and it is a fake one for examples and tests, then a good name for it would be `loanbook_fake`. This format works well with auto-completion.

* A help file including:
    * A title and description that applies to the specific dataset.
    * `@seealso data_dictionary`.
    * `@family` linking to similar datasets if any.
    * `@examples` giving an overview of the dataset.

```r
# R/loanbook_fake.R 

#' A fake loanbook dataset
#'
#' A dataframe containing fake loanbook data. This is a public dataset useful
#' for examples and tests.
#'
#' @seealso data_dictionary
#' @family bank datasets
#' @examples
#' loanbook_fake
"loanbook_fake"
```
